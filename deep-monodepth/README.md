# Monocular depth estimation using AdaBins

## Description

This directory contains the demo of monocular depth estimation using AdaBins.

AdaBins is a deep learning module for monocular depth estimation proposed by Bhat et. al. (2020). See details in their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14141).

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Clone AdaBins repository: `git clone https://github.com/shariqfarooq123/AdaBins.git`
3. Download the pretrained weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nYyaQXOBjNdUJDsmJpcRpu6oE55aQoLA) and put it `pretrained` directory.
4. Explore the `run_monodepth.ipynb`!
